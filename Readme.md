# Gym Management Platform - Project Description

## Project Overview

This project aims to develop a **Gym Management Platform** that facilitates the management of training sessions for both **customers** and **personal trainers**. The platform will allow customers to **schedule sessions** with their preferred trainer, while trainers can **create personalized training programs** for customers. Additionally, the platform will feature an **algorithm to find the optimal schedule** for both trainers and customers.

The system will consist of:
- A **web interface** for both trainers and customers.
- A **backend system** for managing data related to users, sessions, schedules, and gym memberships.
- **API endpoints** to enable interaction between the frontend and backend.

## System Features

### 1. User Roles
The platform will support two main user roles:
- **Customers:** Users who sign up and book training sessions.
- **Trainers:** Users who manage training sessions and programs for customers. They can be **associated with gyms** or operate independently.

### 2. Trainer & Customer Associations
- **Trainer-Gym Association:** A trainer can be associated with one or more gyms.
- **Customer-Training Association:** A customer can be related to:
  - A specific gym and its available trainers.
  - A specific trainer but not tied to a gym.
  - Neither (in this case, the customer can only browse the available information without being able to book sessions).

### 3. Scheduling System
- Customers will be able to **view available trainers** and **book training sessions** based on the trainer's schedule.
- Trainers will input their **availability** and allow customers to choose a time for training.
- The system will also allow the creation of **personalized programs** for customers based on their fitness goals.

### 4. Trainer & Gym Association
- Each trainer can be linked to one or more gyms, and a gym can have multiple trainers working at the same time.
- Trainers who are **not associated with any gym** can still work independently and provide training sessions for customers.

### 5. Customer Preferences & Scheduling Algorithm
- Customers can specify their preferred training times (e.g., afternoons, weekends).
- The system will have an **optimal scheduling algorithm** that finds the best available time for a session based on the **trainer’s availability** and the **customer’s preferences**.
- The system will check for **conflicts** in the schedule and suggest time slots when both the customer and trainer are available.

### 6. Customer Profile and Membership
- Customers will have a **profile** that includes their personal information, goals, and preferences for training times.
- A customer can be **part of a gym** or work with a **freelance trainer**.
- **Gym members** will have access to trainers within that gym, while customers working with freelance trainers will book independently of a gym’s schedule.

### 7. Training Session Management
- Both trainers and customers can view upcoming and past sessions.
- Trainers will be able to **create, modify, and delete training programs** for customers.
- **Session reminders** will be sent to customers and trainers before each session to ensure punctuality.
